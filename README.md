# LAM_Render

A lightweight WebGL Render for [LAM](https://https://github.com/aigc3d/LAM) and [LAM_Audio2Expression](https://https://github.com/aigc3d/LAM_Audio2Expression).

### How to run this project

1. run "npm install"
2. run "npm run dev"
3. open "http://localhost:5173/" with your browser

**\*\***Note**\*\***:  This repository demonstrates that our rendering engine (gaussian-splat-renderer-for-lam) can render models generated by LAM and expressions generated by LAM_Audio2Expression in real time. The avater example can be found in /asset/arkit/p2-1.zip and expression example data can be found in /asset/test_expression_1s.json.

 Our rendering engine is now available as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gaussian-splat-renderer-for-lam). For usage instructions, refer to the installation section below.

````javascript
npm install gaussian-splat-renderer-for-lam
````

#### This is a simple rendering code for LAM, which shows only the avatar, with no expressions or animations.

```javascript
    import * as GaussianSplats3D from 'gaussian-splat-renderer-for-lam';
    const div = document.getElementById('GaussianRenderer');
    const assetPath = './asset/arkit/p2-1.zip'; //the real asset address
    const render = await GaussianSplats3D.GaussianSplatRenderer.getInstance(div, assetPath);

```

### If you want to chat with the avatar, visit **[OpenAvatarChat](https://github.com/HumanAIGC-Engineering/OpenAvatarChat)**, which integrates our LAM rendering capabilities.

### If you want to change the avatar or create a custom one, visit [LAM](https://https://github.com/aigc3d/LAM) to generate a new avatar and replace the existing avatar ZIP file.

# ✨ New Features（LAM Support）

- ****LAM Real-Time Rendering Integration**\*\*: Optimized the native 3D Gaussian Splatting renderer to support **[**LAM**](**https://aigc3d.github.io/projects/LAM/**)** dynamic scene interactions and performance enhancements.
- **\*\***NPM Package Release**\*\***: Published as an **[**NPM package**](**https://www.npmjs.com/package/gaussian-splat-renderer-for-lam**)** for direct usage via **\`npm install\`**.
